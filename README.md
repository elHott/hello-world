# hello-world2

Hi Humans,

I'm learning how GitHub works by first doing the Hello-World tutorial. This is hello-world2 because when I did hello-world originally I hit enter before filling out all the fields and that repository was created before I was ready. I couldn't quickly figure out how to delete that repository so I could start over, so I made hello-world2.
